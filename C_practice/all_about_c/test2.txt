The choice of file extensions (.txt in this case) is based on the nature and purpose of the file:

Input Data File (.txt):

The file you're using for input is generally a data file containing input values or test cases for your program.
Using a .txt extension indicates that the file is a plain text file, containing human-readable text data.
It's a common convention to use .txt for files that contain data rather than executable code.
C Source Code File (.c):

The .c extension is typically reserved for C source code files.
C source code files contain the actual programming instructions written in the C language.
Executable files compiled from C source code usually have a different extension, such as .exe on Windows or no extension on Unix-like systems.
When you're working with C programs, it's standard practice to use .c for your source code files and other extensions (or no extension) for different types of files. The .txt extension for the input file is just a convention to signify that the file contains plain text data and is not executable code.

In summary, the choice of file extensions helps users and developers quickly understand the contents and purpose of the file. It's a way of organizing and identifying files based on their content and intended use.
